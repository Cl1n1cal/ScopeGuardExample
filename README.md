# ScopeGuardExample

Hi everyone.

I wanted to learn more about RAII in cpp and could not find a good example on the internet.
That's why I uploaded this example to Github. Maybe more examples will follow in the future.

Feel free to send me an email if you have some constructive feedback: cl1nical@yahoo.com

I do by no means claim to be an expert developer and use of the code in this repo is at your own expence.

Best Regards,
Cl1nical
